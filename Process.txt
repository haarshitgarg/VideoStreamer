QUESTION 1: What type of server?

=> A lot of options tbh

QUESTION 2: What are we communicating over?

=> Can communicate over internet. Or over home wifi. Or LAN or USB-C
    And this will affect the bandwidth (so in turn affect the type and amount of data we can send)

QUESTION 3: How do you create packets? I know you create them because I know that's how you transfer information
